"""Read the event names a workflow declares under `on:`.

The pull-request cancel contract decides which workflows are in scope from
their triggers, so a reader that misread a shape would drop a workflow from
every contract in silence. GitHub accepts a mapping of event to
configuration, a list of event names, and a bare event name; all three are
read. PyYAML resolves an unquoted `on:` key to the boolean ``True``, so both
spellings of the key are read, and a document carrying both is refused
because GitHub would see one trigger set and this reader another.

    dropping an entry would read a different trigger set from GitHub's.

    ----------
