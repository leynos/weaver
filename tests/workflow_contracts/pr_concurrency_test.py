"""Contracts cancelling superseded pull-request runs.

Every push to a pull request starts a fresh run of each gate, and the run
already in flight is answering a question about a commit nobody will merge.
Left alone it holds a paid runner until it finishes, so the branch pays twice
for one answer. A concurrency group keyed on the pull request makes the newer
run cancel the older one.

Cancellation has to stay conditioned on the event. A literal
``cancel-in-progress: true`` would also cancel a push to `main`, a schedule,
and a dispatch, none of which has a successor waiting: the run that writes the
warm cache on `main` would be killed by the next merge. The condition is
therefore part of the contract, and
`test_cancellation_is_conditioned_on_the_event` fails on the literal.

The group also has to distinguish one pull request from another. A group
derived from ``github.run_id`` is unique per run and so cancels nothing, while
a constant group would let one branch cancel another's gates, and so would one
keyed on ``github.head_ref``, which two forks' `patch-1` branches share. Rather
than search the group's text for a name, the contract renders it against a
small set of run contexts and compares the results.

Only `pull_request` is in scope. A `pull_request_target` workflow runs against
the base repository to carry a token, and the one here merges Dependabot pull
requests; cancelling a merge mid-flight is a hazard with no minutes to win.

Workflows are read through `workflow_loader`, which refuses duplicate mapping keys.
PyYAML otherwise keeps the last of two `concurrency:` blocks and says nothing,
so a correct block could sit above a wrong one and pass.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
