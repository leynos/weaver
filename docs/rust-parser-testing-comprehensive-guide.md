# A comprehensive guide to testing logos, chumsky, and rowan parsers in Rust

## Executive summary

The construction of robust language tooling—compilers, interpreters, static
analysis tools, and formatters—is a formidable engineering challenge. At the
core of this challenge lies the parser, a component whose correctness,
resilience, and performance dictate system quality, usability, and
maintainability across the entire system. In the Rust ecosystem, a powerful
stack has emerged for this purpose, combining the high-performance lexical
analysis of `logos`, the expressive, error-recovering parsing of `chumsky`, and
the lossless, full-fidelity syntax tree representation of `rowan`. While these
tools provide an exceptional foundation, building a production-grade parser
requires an equally sophisticated testing strategy.

This report presents a comprehensive, multi-layered guide to testing parsers
built with this modern Rust stack. It moves beyond rudimentary examples to
establish a holistic testing philosophy tailored to the unique demands of
language engineering. The methodologies detailed herein treat testing not as a
post-development chore but as an integral part of the design and implementation
process, essential for ensuring correctness, enabling confident refactoring,
and delivering a high-quality experience for the language's users. The
strategies are organized progressively, from foundational unit tests to
advanced generative techniques, providing a complete roadmap for implementers.
The intended audience is the experienced Rust developer, already conversant
with the language's idioms and the `rstest` testing framework, who seeks to
build a truly resilient and maintainable parsing pipeline.

## Section 1: foundational testing paradigms for Rust parsers

Before delving into the specifics of testing each component, it is crucial to
establish a conceptual framework. A parser's testing strategy is not
monolithic; it is a layered approach where different techniques are applied to
validate different aspects of the system. This section outlines this framework,
adapting classic testing models to the domain of language engineering and
defining the roles of the key testing libraries used throughout this guide.

### 1.1 The testing pyramid in language engineering

The traditional testing pyramid advocates for a large base of fast, isolated
unit tests, a smaller layer of integration tests, and a very small number of
slow, end-to-end tests. While this model is broadly applicable, the highly
interconnected nature of a parsing pipeline necessitates a nuanced adaptation.
The components of a parser—lexer, parser rules, and syntax tree—are not
independent units but stages in a data transformation pipeline. A subtle change
in a token definition within the lexer can have cascading effects, altering the
structure of the final syntax tree or the quality of error messages.[^1]

This interconnectedness suggests that unit tests focusing on individual
components remain valuable, yet the highest leverage often comes from tests
that validate the integration of these components. A single, well-designed test
that verifies the entire process from source text to final Abstract Syntax Tree
(AST) can provide more assurance than hundreds of isolated unit tests.
Consequently, the ideal testing structure for a parser often resembles a
"diamond" or an "inverted pyramid" more than a classic one. The base is still
composed of unit tests for specific edge cases, but the most significant
investment is in the middle layer of integration and snapshot tests, and at the
peak with powerful property-based tests that verify universal invariants of the
system.

This approach challenges the conventional wisdom of "many unit tests, few
integration tests." The parser's correctness is an emergent property of its
interacting components. A round-trip property test, for instance, which asserts
that parsing the output of a pretty-printer yields the original AST
(`parse(pretty_print(ast)) == ast`), inherently validates every token
definition, every parser rule, and the structural integrity of the AST in a
single, powerful check.[^2] Therefore, establishing the infrastructure for
comprehensive snapshot and property-based testing early in the development
lifecycle yields a disproportionately high return on investment for ensuring
the parser's long-term correctness and maintainability.

### 1.2 Structuring the test suite

A well-organized test suite is critical for maintainability. Rust's standard
testing conventions provide a solid foundation.[^3]

- **Unit Tests:** Tests covering individual lexer tokens, or isolated parser
  rules, are best placed within a `mod tests` block, annotated with
  `#[cfg(test)]`, inside the source file where the code under test is defined.
  This co-location makes it easy to find and update tests when the
  corresponding implementation changes.

- **Integration and Corpus-Based Tests:** Larger tests, especially those that
  operate on entire source files, are typically placed in a top-level `tests/`
  directory. Each file in this directory is compiled as a separate crate, which
  naturally enforces testing only the public API of the library.[^4] This is
  the ideal location for snapshot tests that run against a corpus of valid and
  invalid code samples, a common practice for validating parser correctness
  across a wide range of language features.[^5] For larger projects, it can be
  beneficial to move even unit tests to their own files (e.g.,

  `src/my_module/tests.rs`) to keep source files from becoming unwieldy with
  test code.

To navigate the different testing methodologies, the following table summarizes
the primary tools and their roles within the context of parser development. It
serves as a mental model for selecting the right tool for a given testing task.

The main strategies, along with their supporting tools, are:

- **Example-Based Testing** with `rstest`: Verifies specific scenarios and
  handles edge cases or known bugs. Best used for token validation, precedence
  rules, and edge case handling.
- **Snapshot Testing** using `insta`: Detects regressions in full syntax trees
  or error diagnostics. Best used for AST structure validation, error message
  quality, and Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) losslessness verification.
- **Property-Based Testing** powered by `proptest`: Uncovers unforeseen bugs via
  random input generation and round-trip validation. Best used for parser
  robustness, AST round-trips, and invariant testing.

This structured approach—combining conventional file organization, a clear
understanding of each testing paradigm's purpose, plus targeted tooling—lays
the groundwork for the robust and maintainable test suite detailed in the
following sections.

## Section 2: rigorous testing of the `logos` lexer

The lexer, or tokenizer, is the first stage of the parsing pipeline. Its
responsibility is to transform a raw stream of characters into a structured
stream of tokens. An error at this stage—an incorrect token kind, a
miscalculated span, or a failure to handle an invalid character—will propagate
and corrupt all subsequent stages. `logos` is a library designed to create
exceptionally fast lexers by compiling token definitions into an optimized
deterministic state machine.[^6] Testing a

`logos`-based lexer, therefore, involves verifying the correctness of this
generated state machine across a wide range of inputs.

### 2.1 Core token validation with `rstest`

The most fundamental lexer tests verify that simple, unambiguous inputs produce
the correct tokens. The `rstest` crate is exceptionally well-suited for this
task, allowing for the creation of concise, table-driven tests using the
`#[case]` attribute.[^7] These tests form the bedrock of the lexer's test
suite, covering the "happy path" for each token definition.

A typical test will verify that a given input string lexes to a specific
sequence of expected tokens. For simple tokens like punctuation or keywords,
this is straightforward.

```rust,no_run
// In src/lexer.rs

use logos::Logos;

#[logos(skip r"[ \t\n\f]+")] // Ignore whitespace
pub enum Token<'a> {
    #[token("(")] LParen,
    #[token(")")] RParen,
    #[token("{")] LBrace,
    #[token("}")] RBrace,
    #[token("let")] Let,
    #[token("fn")] Fn,
    #[regex("[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*", |lex| lex.slice())]
    Ident(&'a str),
    #[regex("[0-9]+", |lex| lex.slice().parse())]
    Integer(u64),
    #[error]
    Error,
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use rstest::rstest;

    #[rstest]
    fn test_single_simple_tokens(#[case] input: &str, #[case] expected: Token) {
        let mut lexer = Token::lexer(input);

        // Assert that the lexer produces exactly one token
        assert_eq!(lexer.next(), Some(Ok(expected)));

        // Assert that the lexer is exhausted
        assert_eq!(lexer.next(), None);
    }

    #[rstest]
    fn test_single_data_tokens(#[case] input: &str, #[case] expected: Token) {
        let mut lexer = Token::lexer(input);
        assert_eq!(lexer.next(), Some(Ok(expected)));
        assert_eq!(lexer.next(), None);
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Asserting spans and slices

While verifying the token's kind is essential, it is insufficient. The
downstream components, `chumsky` and `rowan`, critically depend on accurate
source location information (the span) and the original text (the slice) for
each token.[^8]

`chumsky` uses spans to generate precise, user-friendly error messages that
point to the exact location of a syntax error.[^9]

`rowan` uses the token's text and length to construct a lossless Concrete
Syntax Tree (CST) that can be perfectly pretty-printed back to the original
source.[^10]

Therefore, a bug in a token's span is not merely a lexer issue; it is a
critical flaw that will manifest as misleading error diagnostics or a corrupted
syntax tree. Testing spans, together with slices, must be treated as a
first-class concern, on par with testing the token kind itself. The
`logos::Lexer` provides the `span()` and `slice()` methods to access this
information, and these should be asserted in every relevant test.[^11]

```rust,no_run
// Continuing in #[cfg(test)] mod tests

#[rstest]
// input, expected token, expected slice, expected span
fn test_token_spans_and_slices(
    #[case] input: &str,
    #[case] expected_token: Token,
    #[case] expected_slice: &str,
    #[case] expected_span: std::ops::Range<usize>,
) {
    let mut lexer = Token::lexer(input);

    let result = lexer.next();
    assert!(result.is_some(), "Lexer did not produce a token");
    let token = result.unwrap();
    assert!(token.is_ok(), "Lexer produced an error");

    assert_eq!(token.unwrap(), expected_token);
    assert_eq!(lexer.slice(), expected_slice);
    assert_eq!(lexer.span(), expected_span);

    assert_eq!(lexer.next(), None, "Lexer produced more than one token");
}
```

This pattern of testing a `(Token, Slice, Span)` tuple should be the default.

### 2.3 Handling ambiguity and precedence

A common source of subtle lexer bugs arises from ambiguous token definitions
where one token is a prefix of another. A classic example is the set of tokens
for single-character operators versus their two-character counterparts (e.g.,
`+` vs. `++`, `!` vs. `!=`). `logos` resolves this ambiguity by always
preferring the longest possible match.[^12] Test cases must be explicitly
designed to verify this outcome.

Another related issue, highlighted in a user forum post, occurs when multiple
regexes can match at the same position, such as `r"\\"` and `r"\\begin"`.[^13]
The order of declaration in the

`enum` can influence which token is matched. While `logos` attempts to
prioritize longer matches, complex regex interactions can sometimes lead to
surprising results. The `#[token(…, priority = N)]` attribute can be used to
explicitly resolve these ambiguities by assigning a higher priority to more
specific tokens.

Tests should target these specific ambiguities:

```rust,no_run
// In src/lexer.rs, add new tokens for ambiguity test
#[logos(skip r"[ \t\n\f]+")]
pub enum AmbiguousToken<'a> {
    #[token("=")] Assign,
    #[token("==")] Equal,
    #[token("=>")] FatArrow,

    // A more specific keyword should have a higher priority
    // than a general identifier.
    #[token("let_me_in", priority = 2)]
    LetMeIn,

    #[regex("[a-z_]+")]
    Ident(&'a str),

    #[error] Error,
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use rstest::rstest;

    #[rstest]
    fn test_longest_match_and_priority(
        #[case] input: &str,
        #[case] expected: AmbiguousToken,
    ) {
        let mut lexer = AmbiguousToken::lexer(input);
        assert_eq!(lexer.next(), Some(Ok(expected)));
        assert_eq!(lexer.next(), None);
    }
}
```

### 2.4 Testing callbacks and state-driven lexing

For more complex tokens, `logos` supports callbacks—Rust functions that are
executed when a token pattern is matched. These callbacks can inspect the
matched slice, perform arbitrary computations, and even modify the lexer's
state. This is essential for handling constructs like C-style block comments,
strings with escape sequences, or nested delimiters.

Testing callbacks involves verifying that the logic within the callback is
correct. This includes testing successful transformations, error conditions,
and special lexer actions like `logos::Skip`. The `logos` repository's own test
suite provides excellent examples of these patterns.[^14]

Consider a callback that parses hexadecimal integer literals; it can fail if
the number is too large:

```rust,no_run
// In src/lexer.rs
use logos::{Lexer, Logos};
use std::num::ParseIntError;

pub enum CallbackError {
    InvalidInt(ParseIntError),
}

fn parse_hex(lex: &mut Lexer<CallbackToken>) -> Result<u32, CallbackError> {
    // Strip the "0x" prefix and parse the rest.
    let slice = &lex.slice()[2..];
    u32::from_str_radix(slice, 16).map_err(CallbackError::InvalidInt)
}

#[logos(error = CallbackError)]
pub enum CallbackToken {
    #[regex("0x[0-9a-fA-F]+", parse_hex)]
    Hex(u32),
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use rstest::rstest;

    #[test]
    fn test_hex_callback_success() {
        let mut lexer = CallbackToken::lexer("0xFF");
        assert_eq!(lexer.next(), Some(Ok(CallbackToken::Hex(255))));
        assert_eq!(lexer.slice(), "0xFF");
        assert_eq!(lexer.span(), 0..4);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_hex_callback_failure() {
        // This value is too large to fit in a u32
        let mut lexer = CallbackToken::lexer("0x100000000");
        let result = lexer.next();

        // Assert that the lexer produced an error.
        assert!(result.is_some());
        let err = result.unwrap().unwrap_err();

        // Check that it's the specific error expected from the callback.
        assert!(matches!(err, CallbackError::InvalidInt(_)));
    }
}
```

### 2.5 A reusable lexer test harness

To reduce boilerplate and ensure consistency across tests, it is highly
beneficial to create a reusable test harness. This can be a function or macro
that takes a source string and an expected sequence of tokens and performs all
necessary assertions in a loop. This pattern, inspired by helpers like
`assert_lex` in the `logos` repository [^15], centralizes the testing logic and
makes the tests themselves much more declarative and readable.

```rust,no_run
// In a test helper module, e.g., tests/common.rs
// (Or within the #[cfg(test)] mod)
use logos::Logos;
use std::fmt::Debug;

pub fn assert_lex<'a, T>(
    source: &'a str,
    expected_tokens: &[(T, &'a str, std::ops::Range<usize>)],
) 
where
    T: Logos<'a> + PartialEq + Debug,
    T::Error: PartialEq + Debug,
{
    let mut lexer = T::lexer(source);
    let mut index = 0;

    while let Some(token_result) = lexer.next() {
        if index >= expected_tokens.len() {
            panic!(
                "Lexer produced more tokens than expected. Extra token: {:?}",
                token_result
            );
        }

        let (expected_token, expected_slice, expected_span) =
            &expected_tokens[index];
        let token = token_result.unwrap_or_else(|err| {
            panic!("Unexpected lexer error at index {}: {:?}", index, err)
        });

        assert_eq!(
            &token,
            expected_token,
            "Token kind mismatch at index {}",
            index
        );
        assert_eq!(lexer.slice(), *expected_slice, "Token slice mismatch at index {}", index);
        assert_eq!(lexer.span(), *expected_span, "Token span mismatch at index {}", index);

        index += 1;
    }

    if index < expected_tokens.len() {
        panic!("Lexer produced fewer tokens than expected. Expected {}, got {}", expected_tokens.len(), index);
    }
}

// Example usage in a test file:
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::super::Token; // Assuming Token is in the parent module
    use super::assert_lex;   // Assuming assert_lex is in the same test module or imported

    #[test]
    fn test_sequence_with_harness() {
        let source = "let x = 10;";
        assert_lex(
            source,
            &[
                (Token::Let, "let", 0..3),
                (Token::Ident("x"), "x", 4..5),
                (Token::Assign, "=", 6..7),
                (Token::Integer(10), "10", 8..10),
                (Token::Semicolon, ";", 10..11),
            ],
        );
    }
}
```

This harness provides a robust foundation for the lexer test suite, ensuring
that every aspect of the token—its kind, its text, and its position—is
validated with every test run.

## Section 3: comprehensive validation of `chumsky` parsers

With a correctly tokenized stream from `logos`, the next stage is the `chumsky`
parser. `chumsky` is a parser combinator library designed for expressiveness,
performance, and, most notably, high-quality error recovery.[^16] Testing a

`chumsky` parser involves verifying not only that it correctly parses valid
input into an AST but also that it gracefully handles invalid input, reports
meaningful errors, and recovers to parse the rest of the file.

### 3.1 Unit testing individual parser rules

The combinator-based nature of `chumsky` encourages a bottom-up approach to
parser construction. Complex parsers are built by combining smaller, simpler
parsers.[^17] This modularity is a significant advantage for testing, as each
small parser can be tested in isolation.

To unit test a specific parser rule, one should feed it a pre-tokenized slice
(`&[(Token<'a>, &'a str, std::ops::Range<usize>)]`) rather than a raw string.
This isolates the parser logic from the lexer, ensuring that the test is
focused solely on how the combinators operate. The parser's `parse` method
returns a `ParseResult`, which contains either the output AST and a vector of
non-fatal errors, or just a vector of fatal errors.[^18] Tests should assert
against both the output and the error vector.

```rust,no_run
// Assuming an AST definition like this:

pub enum Stmt<'a> {
    Let {
        name: &'a str,
        value: Expr<'a>,
    },
    //… other statements
}

pub enum Expr<'a> {
    Literal(u64),
    //… other expressions
}

// And a parser function for 'let' statements:
use chumsky::prelude::*;
use crate::lexer::Token; // Token enum defined by the parser

fn let_parser<'a>(
) -> impl Parser<
    'a,
    &'a [(Token<'a>, &'a str, std::ops::Range<usize>)],
    Stmt<'a>,
    extra::Err<Simple<Token<'a>>>,
>
{
    just(Token::Let)
       .ignore_then(select! { Token::Ident(ident) => ident })
       .then_ignore(just(Token::Assign)) // Assuming Token::Assign exists
       .then(select! { Token::Integer(val) => Expr::Literal(val) })
       .then_ignore(just(Token::Semicolon)) // Assuming Token::Semicolon exists
       .map(|(name, value)| Stmt::Let { name, value })
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use crate::lexer::Token;
    use chumsky::Parser;

    #[test]
    fn test_valid_let_statement() {
        let tokens = vec![
            (Token::Let, "let", 0..3),
            (Token::Ident("x"), "x", 4..5),
            (Token::Assign, "=", 6..7),
            (Token::Integer(42), "42", 8..10),
            (Token::Semicolon, ";", 10..11),
        ];

        let result = let_parser().parse(&tokens).into_result();

        assert_eq!(
            result,
            Ok(Stmt::Let { name: "x", value: Expr::Literal(42) })
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_invalid_let_statement_missing_semicolon() {
        let tokens = vec![
            (Token::Let, "let", 0..3),
            (Token::Ident("x"), "x", 4..5),
            (Token::Assign, "=", 6..7),
            (Token::Integer(42), "42", 8..10),
        ];

        let (ast, errs) = let_parser().parse(&tokens).into_output_errors();

        // The parser should fail because the semicolon is required.
        assert!(ast.is_none());
        // And it should report one error.
        assert_eq!(errs.len(), 1);
        // Inspect the error further if needed.
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Snapshot testing: the key to taming ASTs and errors

While `assert_eq!` is suitable for simple AST nodes, it quickly becomes
unwieldy for complex, nested structures. Manually writing out expected ASTs in
test code is tedious, error-prone, and makes refactoring the grammar a
nightmare. This is where snapshot testing with the `insta` crate becomes
indispensable.[^19]

`insta` enables asserting that a complex value matches a “snapshot”—a reference
representation stored in a separate file. On the first run, the snapshot is
created. On subsequent runs, the test output is compared against the stored
snapshot. If they differ, the test fails, and a rich diff is presented. The
developer can then either fix the code or, if the change was intentional,
update the snapshot with `cargo insta review`.[^20]

This workflow is transformative for parser development. When the language
syntax evolves, the AST structure necessarily changes. Instead of manually
updating dozens of `assert_eq!` calls, a developer can simply update the parser
logic, run the tests, and then interactively review the new AST structures
before accepting them as the new "golden" standard. This dramatically
accelerates iteration and refactoring.[^21]

The best practice is to snapshot the entire `ParseResult`, which includes both
the (potentially partial) AST and the list of errors. This provides a complete
picture of the parser's output for a given input.

```rust,no_run
// In tests/parser_snapshots.rs

// A helper function to combine lexing and parsing for snapshot tests.
fn parse_for_snapshot(source: &str) -> String {
    let tokens = MyToken::lexer(source).spanned().collect::<Vec<_>>();
    let (ast, errs) = my_root_parser().parse(&tokens).into_output_errors();

    // Format the output for a clean snapshot.
    format!(
        "--- AST ---\n{:#?}\n\n--- Errors ---\n{:#?}",
        ast,
        errs.into_iter().map(|e| e.to_string()).collect::<Vec<_>>()
    )
}

#[test]
fn snapshot_simple_function() {
    let source = r#"
        fn main() {
            let x = 1;
        }
    "#;
    insta::assert_snapshot!(parse_for_snapshot(source));
}
```

When this test is run for the first time, `insta` will create a file like
`tests/snapshots/parser_snapshots__snapshot_simple_function.snap` containing
the formatted AST and error output.

### 3.3 Mastering error recovery testing

`chumsky`'s most powerful feature is its support for flexible error recovery
strategies.[^22] A robust parser should not stop at the first error; it should
report the error, attempt to resynchronize, and continue parsing to find
subsequent errors. This provides a much better user experience.

Testing error recovery requires a dedicated suite of tests that use malformed
inputs. For each invalid input, the test must verify two critical properties:

1. **Correct Errors:** The parser produced the expected set of errors, with the
   correct error messages and spans.

2. **Correct Recovery:** The parser successfully recovered and was able to
   produce a useful partial AST for the valid parts of the code.

Snapshot testing is the perfect tool for this. By snapshotting both the error
vector and the resulting partial AST, this validates the overall semantics of
the error recovery mechanism.

```rust,no_run
// In tests/parser_error_recovery.rs

#[test]
fn snapshot_recovery_from_missing_semicolon() {
    let source = r#"
        fn main() {
            let x = 1  // <-- Missing semicolon
            let y = 2;
        }
    "#;
    // Use the same helper as before.
    insta::assert_snapshot!(parse_for_snapshot(source));
}
```

The resulting snapshot should show an error message like "Expected semicolon"
and an AST that contains *both* the `let x = 1` and `let y = 2;` statements,
proving that recovery was successful. Experimenting with different recovery
strategies (e.g., `recover_with(skip_then_retry_until(…))`), and snapshotting
the results, is the most effective way to fine-tune how the parser responds to
invalid input.[^23]

### 3.4 Validating Pratt parsers (expression parsing)

Parsing expressions with operator precedence, as well as associativity, is a
classic parsing problem. `chumsky` provides a built-in `pratt` parser that
simplifies this immensely.[^24] Testing a Pratt parser involves systematically
verifying that it respects the defined precedence and associativity rules.

`rstest` is again an excellent choice for creating a table of expression inputs
and their expected AST representations.

To make assertions easier, it's common to represent the expected expression
tree in a simple, readable format like S-expressions.

```rust,no_run
// In ddlint, prefer: expr.to_sexpr().
// The helper below is illustrative for this guide.
fn to_sexpr(expr: &Expr) -> String {
    //… implementation…
    // e.g., Add(Box(Literal(1)), Box(Literal(2))) -> "(+ 1 2)"
}

#[rstest]
// input, expected s-expression
#[case("1 + 2 * 3", "(+ 1 (* 2 3))")] // Precedence
#[case("1 * 2 + 3", "(+ (* 1 2) 3)")] // Precedence
#[case("8 - 4 - 2", "(- (- 8 4) 2)")] // Left-associativity
#[case("-5 + 2", "(+ (- 5) 2)")]      // Unary operator
#[case("-(5 + 2)", "(- (+ 5 2))")]    // Parentheses
fn test_pratt_parser_expressions(#[case] input: &str, #[case] expected: &str) {
    let tokens = MyToken::lexer(input).collect();
    let (ast, errs) = expr_parser().parse(&tokens).into_output_errors();

    assert!(errs.is_empty(), "Parse errors found: {:?}", errs);
    assert!(ast.is_some(), "Parser did not produce an AST");
    assert_eq!(ast.unwrap().to_sexpr(), expected);
}
```

This suite of tests ensures that the core expression parsing logic, a
notoriously tricky part of any language, matches the specification precisely.

## Section 4: ensuring the integrity of `rowan` lossless syntax trees

The final output of the combined `logos` and `chumsky` pipeline is often a
`rowan` tree. `rowan` provides data structures for creating a Concrete Syntax
Tree (CST). Unlike a traditional Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), a `rowan` CST is
"lossless" or "full-fidelity," meaning it represents the source text exactly,
including all whitespace, comments, and even syntax errors.[^25] This makes it
an ideal data structure for tooling that needs to inspect or modify source code
without losing formatting, such as IDEs, formatters, and refactoring
engines.[^26]

### 4.1 The `rowan` philosophy: losslessness and its testing implications

The core design of `rowan` separates the tree's structure (the "green tree,"
which is immutable and untyped) from the view or cursor into it (the "red
tree," which provides a typed, parent-aware API).[^27] The library itself
provides the generic tree data structures (`GreenNode`, `SyntaxNode`); the
user's parser is responsible for correctly constructing the tree using a
`GreenNodeBuilder`.[^28]

This architecture has a profound implication for testing: a bug found in a
`rowan` CST is rarely a bug in the `rowan` library itself. Rather, it is a bug
in the parser logic that called `builder.start_node()`, `builder.token()`, or
`builder.finish_node()` in the wrong sequence. `rowan` is extensively tested
within its primary use case, `rust-analyzer`.[^29] Therefore, testing a

`rowan` tree is the ultimate end-to-end integration test of the entire parsing
pipeline. The CST represents the final, complete output produced by the parsing
pipeline—an observable integration artefact.

### 4.2 The golden test: verifying losslessness via pretty-printing

The most fundamental property of a lossless syntax tree is that it can be
perfectly "unparsed" or "pretty-printed" back to the original source text. This
forms the basis of the "golden test" for a `rowan`-based parser. The process is
simple:

1. Parse a source string into a `rowan::SyntaxNode`.

2. Traverse the `SyntaxNode`, concatenating the text of every `SyntaxToken`
   (including trivia like whitespace and comments).

3. Assert that the resulting string is byte-for-byte identical to the original
   input string.

If this property holds for a comprehensive corpus of source files, it provides
extremely high confidence that the parser is correctly capturing the entire
structure of the language.

```rust,no_run
// In tests/rowan_tests.rs
use rowan::SyntaxNode;
use crate::lang::MyLang; // Language trait implementation

// A simple pretty-printer that traverses the CST.
fn pretty_print(node: SyntaxNode<MyLang>) -> String {
    let mut out = String::new();
    for element in node.children_with_tokens() {
        match element {
            rowan::NodeOrToken::Node(n) => out.push_str(&pretty_print(n)),
            rowan::NodeOrToken::Token(t) => out.push_str(t.text()),
        }
    }
    out
}

#[test]
fn test_losslessness_round_trip() {
    let source = r#"
    // A comment
    fn main() { let x = 1; }
    "#;

    let parse_result = crate::parser::parse(source); // Assume this returns a root SyntaxNode
    let syntax_node = parse_result.syntax();

    let rebuilt_source = pretty_print(syntax_node);

    assert_eq!(source, rebuilt_source);
}
```

### 4.3 Snapshotting the CST

While the losslessness test is vital, it doesn't make the internal structure of
the CST visible. The `Debug` implementation for `rowan::SyntaxNode` produces a
beautifully formatted, indented tree. It enumerates the kind and span for every
node and includes the corresponding tokens.[^30] This debug representation is a
perfect candidate for snapshot testing with `insta`.

By snapshotting the CST, developers gain a human-readable "golden" record of
the entire parse result for a given input. This is invaluable for debugging the
parser's logic and for reviewing the impact of grammar changes.

Combining this with `rstest`'s `#[files]` attribute provides a powerful
mechanism for data-driven testing. A directory of source code snippets
(`tests/corpus/`) can serve as the input, and `insta` will generate a
corresponding snapshot file for each one.

```rust,no_run
// In tests/rowan_snapshots.rs
use rstest::rstest;
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn do_cst_snapshot_test(path: &Path) {
    let source = fs::read_to_string(path).unwrap();
    let parse_result = crate::parser::parse(&source);
    let cst = parse_result.syntax();

    // Use insta's `with_settings` to name the snapshot after the input file.
    insta::with_settings!({
        snapshot_path => path.parent().unwrap().join("snapshots"),
        prepend_module_to_snapshot => false,
    }, {
        insta::assert_snapshot!(path.file_name().unwrap().to_str().unwrap(), format!("{:#?}", cst));
    });
}

#[rstest]
#[files("corpus/**/*.mylang")] // Glob pattern for language fixture files
fn test_cst_snapshots(input: &Path) {
    do_cst_snapshot_test(input);
}
```

### 4.4 Typed AST layer and navigational tests

While the raw `SyntaxNode` API is powerful, it is untyped. For semantic
analysis, it is conventional to build a typed AST layer on top of the CST. This
involves creating structs that wrap `SyntaxNode` and provide typed accessor
methods for navigating the tree, as demonstrated in `rowan`'s
`s_expressions.rs` example.[^31]

For example, a `FunctionDef` struct might wrap a `SyntaxNode` of kind `FN_DEF`
and provide methods like `name() -> Option<SyntaxToken>` and
`body() -> Option<BlockExpr>`. Tests targeting this layer should verify that
these navigational methods work correctly. They should check that the accessors
return the expected node types (`Some` for well-formed input, `None` for
malformed input), and they should confirm that the returned nodes are
themselves correct.

```rust,no_run
// Assuming a typed AST layer exists
// ast::FunctionDef wraps a SyntaxNode

#[test]
fn test_typed_ast_navigation() {
    let source = "fn my_func() {}";
    let parse = crate::parser::parse(source);
    let root = ast::Root::cast(parse.syntax()).unwrap();
    let func = root.functions().next().unwrap();

    assert_eq!(func.name().unwrap().text(), "my_func");
    assert!(func.body().is_some());
}

#[test]
fn test_typed_ast_navigation_on_malformed_input() {
    let source = "fn my_func {"; // Missing parens
    let parse = crate::parser::parse(source);
    let root = ast::Root::cast(parse.syntax()).unwrap();
    let func = root.functions().next().unwrap();

    // The name should still be parseable
    assert_eq!(func.name().unwrap().text(), "my_func");
    // But the body, which depends on elements after the name, might not be found.
    // The exact outcome depends on the parser's recovery strategy.
    assert!(func.body().is_none());
}
```

These tests ensure that the "view" into the syntax tree is as robust as the
tree itself, providing a safe and ergonomic API for later compiler stages.

## Section 5: advanced strategies with property-based testing (`proptest`)

The testing strategies discussed so far—example-based and snapshot—are
excellent for verifying known scenarios and preventing regressions. However,
they are limited by the developer's ability to imagine all possible edge cases.
Property-based testing, implemented in Rust by crates like `proptest`, offers a
powerful solution to this problem. Instead of testing against specific inputs,
it tests that certain *properties* or *invariants* of the code hold true for a
vast range of automatically generated, random inputs.[^32] If a failing input
is found,

`proptest` automatically "shrinks" it to the smallest possible test case that
still reproduces the failure, making debugging far easier.[^33]

### 5.1 Introduction to property-based testing

The core workflow of property-based testing is:

1. **Define a Property:** A function that takes one or more generated inputs and
   asserts an invariant. For example, for any list `v`,
   `v.reverse().reverse() == v`.

2. **Generate Inputs:** `proptest` uses "strategies" to generate random inputs
   that conform to certain rules (e.g., integers within a range, strings
   matching a regex, or complex, custom data structures).

3. **Test and Shrink:** The test runner executes the property function hundreds
   or thousands of times with different generated inputs. If an assertion
   fails, `proptest` begins a shrinking process, iteratively simplifying the
   failing input to find a minimal counterexample.

For parsers, this approach is invaluable because it uncovers obscure bugs that
would be nearly impossible to find with handwritten tests.

### 5.2 Fuzzing the lexer and parser for panics

The simplest, and most fundamental, property of any robust program is "it does
not crash." Applying this to a parser means that, regardless of the input
quality, it should never panic. It should either parse successfully or return a
structured error.

A `proptest` test can be written to generate arbitrary strings and feed them
into the full lexer-parser pipeline. This acts as a "fuzz test," probing the
system for robustness failures.

```rust,no_run
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #![proptest_config(ProptestConfig::with_cases(1000))]
    #[test]
    fn parser_does_not_panic(s in "\\PC*") { // "\\PC*" generates any string of non-control characters
        // The test simply runs the pipeline.
        // A panic will cause the test to fail.
        // The `proptest` runner will then find the minimal string that causes the panic.
        let _ = my_language_parser::parse(&s);
    }
}
```

This single, simple test can uncover a wide range of bugs, from out-of-bounds
access in regexes to infinite loops in recursive descent parsers.[^34] The
failure persistence feature of

`proptest` ensures that once a failing case is found, it is saved to a
regression file, and re-run on every subsequent test execution, effectively
turning a discovered bug into a permanent regression test.[^35]

### 5.3 The ultimate property: AST round-trip testing

The most powerful property, for a parser, is round-trip correctness: for any
valid AST, pretty-printing it to a string, and parsing that string back, should
result in an identical AST. This can be expressed as
`parse(pretty_print(ast)) == Ok(ast)`. If this property holds, it provides
exceptionally strong evidence that the parser can correctly handle any valid
program construct that the AST is capable of representing. This is a common and
highly effective strategy used in production-grade systems.[^36]

Implementing this test involves three steps:

#### 5.3.1 Step 1: implementing `Arbitrary` for the AST

`proptest` needs to know how to generate random, valid instances of the AST.
This is achieved by implementing the `proptest::arbitrary::Arbitrary` trait for
each AST node type. While this can be done manually, the `test-strategy` crate
provides a convenient `#[derive(Arbitrary)]` macro that can handle many cases
automatically.[^37]

For a recursive type like an expression tree, manual implementation combined
with carefully constrained derive attributes is necessary to prevent infinite
recursion during generation. This typically involves defining a "leaf" strategy
for non-recursive expressions (like literals) and a recursive strategy that
combines existing expressions. The `prop_oneof!` macro is useful for choosing
between different expression variants.

```rust,no_run
use proptest::prelude::*;
use test_strategy::Arbitrary;

// Simple enum can be derived automatically.
pub enum UnaryOp { Plus, Minus }

pub enum BinaryOp { Add, Sub, Mul, Div }

// The recursive Expr enum requires more control here.
pub enum Expr {
    Literal(u64),
    Unary { op: UnaryOp, expr: Box<Expr> },
    Binary { op: BinaryOp, lhs: Box<Expr>, rhs: Box<Expr> },
    Paren(Box<Expr>),
}

// Manual implementation of Arbitrary for the recursive Expr type.
impl Arbitrary for Expr {
    type Parameters = ();
    type Strategy = BoxedStrategy<Self>;

    fn arbitrary_with(_args: Self::Parameters) -> Self::Strategy {
        // Define a strategy for leaf expressions (non-recursive).
        let leaf = prop_oneof![
            any::<u64>().prop_map(Expr::Literal),
        ];

        // Create a recursive strategy.
        // `leaf.prop_recursive` allows building larger expressions from smaller ones.
        // The first argument is the recursion depth.
        // The second is the maximum size of compound objects (e.g., Vecs).
        // The third argument defines how to build one level of recursion.
        leaf.prop_recursive(
            8, // Max recursion depth
            256, // Max total nodes
            |inner| prop_oneof![
                // Recursive branches for unary and binary operators
                prop_oneof![UnaryOp::Plus, UnaryOp::Minus]
                    .prop_flat_map(|op| {
                        any::<u64>().prop_map(move |_| Expr::Unary {
                            op: op.clone(),
                            expr: Box::new(Expr::Literal(0)),
                        })
                    }),
                prop_oneof![BinaryOp::Add, BinaryOp::Sub, BinaryOp::Mul, BinaryOp::Div]
                    .prop_flat_map(|op| {
                        (inner.clone(), inner.clone()).prop_map(move |(l, r)| Expr::Binary {
                            op: op.clone(),
                            lhs: Box::new(l),
                            rhs: Box::new(r),
                        })
                    }),
            ]
        ).boxed()
    }
}
```

#### 5.3.2 Step 2: implementing the pretty-printer

A deterministic pretty-printer (or "unparser") is required to convert the
generated AST back into a source string. This function must correctly handle
operator precedence by adding parentheses where necessary to preserve the AST's
structure.

```rust,no_run
// A simple pretty-printer for the Expr AST (illustrative).
fn to_sexpr(expr: &Expr) -> String {
    match expr {
        Expr::Literal(n) => n.to_string(),
        Expr::Unary { op, expr } => {
            let op_str = match op { UnaryOp::Plus => "+", UnaryOp::Minus => "-" };
            format!("{}{}", op_str, to_sexpr(expr))
        }
        Expr::Binary { op, lhs, rhs } => {
            let op_str = match op {
                BinaryOp::Add => "+", BinaryOp::Sub => "-",
                BinaryOp::Mul => "*", BinaryOp::Div => "/",
            };
            // This is a simplified printer; a real one would be more careful with parentheses.
            format!("({} {} {})", to_sexpr(lhs), op_str, to_sexpr(rhs))
        }
        Expr::Paren(expr) => format!("({})", to_sexpr(expr)),
    }
}
```

#### 5.3.3 Step 3: writing the property test

With the `Arbitrary` implementation and the pretty-printer in place, the final
property test is remarkably concise.

```rust,no_run
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn ast_round_trip(ast in any::<Expr>()) {
        // 1. Pretty-print the generated AST to a string.
        let code = ast.to_sexpr();

        // 2. Parse the string back into an AST.
        let parsed_result = my_language_parser::parse_expr(&code);

        // 3. Assert that the round-tripped AST is identical to the original.
        prop_assert!(parsed_result.is_ok(), "Parsing the pretty-printed code failed");
        prop_assert_eq!(parsed_result.unwrap(), ast, "Round-tripped AST does not match original");
    }
}
```

This test establishes a powerful feedback loop. A failure does not just
indicate a bug; it points to a fundamental inconsistency between the parser's
understanding of the grammar and the pretty-printer's representation of it. For
example, if the pretty-printer fails to add necessary parentheses around a
lower-precedence operation, the `parse` function will correctly interpret the
resulting string according to its precedence rules, leading to a different AST,
which triggers a test failure. This forces the developer to ensure that the
parser, and the pretty-printer, remain perfectly synchronized, significantly
improving the overall quality and correctness of the language implementation.
This symbiotic relationship elevates the pretty-printer from a simple utility
to a critical component of the testing infrastructure.

## Section 6: conclusion: a holistic testing philosophy for language engineering

The development of a robust parser is a complex endeavour that demands a
testing strategy as sophisticated as the parser itself. This guide has detailed
a multi-layered approach, leveraging the strengths of the modern Rust testing
ecosystem to build confidence in a parser constructed with `logos`, `chumsky`,
and `rowan`. By moving from foundational unit tests to comprehensive snapshot
and property-based tests, developers can create a formidable shield against
regressions, and they can uncover bugs that would otherwise remain hidden.

The key takeaways from this analysis can be synthesized into a holistic testing
philosophy:

1. **Embrace a Layered Strategy:** No single testing method is sufficient. A
   combination of example-based tests with `rstest` for known edge cases,
   snapshot tests with `insta` for complex outputs like ASTs and error reports,
   and property-based tests with `proptest` for universal invariants provides
   comprehensive coverage.

2. **Prioritize High-Leverage Tests:** In the context of parsing, the most
   powerful tests are often those that verify the integration of the entire
   pipeline. The AST round-trip property test and the CST losslessness test are
   paramount. Investing in the infrastructure for these tests—namely,
   `Arbitrary` implementations and a pretty-printer—early in the development
   process yields the highest return.

3. **Treat Spans and Errors as First-Class Citizens:** A parser is not merely a
   validator; it is a critical component of the developer experience. The
   quality of its error messages and the accuracy of its source location
   information are non-negotiable features. Every stage of testing, from the
   `logos` lexer to the `chumsky` parser, must rigorously validate spans and
   error structures, with snapshot testing being the ideal tool for this
   purpose.

4. **Integrate Testing into the Development Workflow:** Tools like `insta` are
   not just for preventing regressions; they are powerful aids for development
   and refactoring. The `cargo insta review` workflow allows for rapid,
   confident iteration on a language's syntax and its corresponding AST
   structure.

For integration into a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment
(CD) pipeline, a tiered approach is recommended. The fast-running unit tests,
and the snapshot tests, should be executed on every commit to provide rapid
feedback. The more computationally expensive `proptest` suites, particularly
the AST round-trip test, can be run nightly, or as a mandatory check before a
release, ensuring that deeper, more subtle bugs are caught without slowing down
the primary development loop.

Ultimately, building a language is an iterative process.[^38] The syntax,
semantics, and tooling will evolve. A robust, multi-faceted test suite is the
single most important asset for managing this evolution. It provides the
confidence needed to refactor, experiment, and extend the language, ensuring
the long-term health, correctness, and maintainability of the entire project.
